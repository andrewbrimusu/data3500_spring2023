# 1. connect to the following web json api url: https://api.datamuse.com/words?ml=duck&sp=b*&max=5
#  - download the json
#  - convert it to a Python dictionary
#  - save it to a json file permanently

# 2. starting with the code you wrote in the programming activity 1
#  - go through the python dictionary and take all of the scores (each word has a score)
#  - append the score to a list, and print the average of the list

# [{"word": "bird", "score": 67510, "tags": ["n"]},
